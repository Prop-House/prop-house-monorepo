[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@prophouse/sdk.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prophouse/sdk)

Useful tools for interacting with the Prop House protocol

## Installation

```sh
npm install @prophouse/sdk
# OR
yarn add @prophouse/sdk
```

## Usage

### Entrypoint
---

The [PropHouse](src/prop-house.ts) class acts as the entrypoint for all Prop House protocol interactions.

#### Features

- [House and round creation](#house--round-creation)
- [Round asset depositing](#round-asset-deposits)
- [Querying of house and round state](#house--round-queries)
- Proposal and vote submission

To create a prop house instance, provide the chain ID and a signer/provider:

```ts
import { ChainId, PropHouse } from '@prophouse/sdk';

const propHouse = new PropHouse({
  evmChainId: ChainId.EthereumGoerli,
  evm: signer, // Alternatively, pass a provider
});
```

### House & Round Creation
---

A round can be created on new or existing house in a single transaction. The round can be fully funded, partially funded, or not funded at all at this time.

When funding a round, the `PropHouse` contract must be approved to spend included tokens prior to the transfer. If funding with ETH, no approval is necessary.

### Round Asset Deposits
---

If a round is not fully funded during creation, it can be funded by **anyone** at any time. This is useful when multiple parties are funding a round, or when a round is funded by someone other than the round creator, such as a DAO.

Upon deposit, a receipt is issued to the depositor. This receipt can be used to reclaim assets while the round is awaiting registration, or in the event of a round cancellation. Receipts are transferrable.

#### Examples

<details>
  <summary>Deposit an asset to a round</summary>

  ```ts
  import { AssetType } from '@prophouse/sdk';

  // ETH
  await propHouse.depositTo(ROUND_ADDRESS, {
    assetType: AssetType.ETH,
    amount: ethers.utils.parseEther('1'),
  });

  // ERC20
  await propHouse.depositTo(ROUND_ADDRESS, {
    assetType: AssetType.ERC20,
    address: ERC20_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
    amount: ERC20_TOKEN_AMOUNT,
  });

  // ERC721
  await propHouse.depositTo(ROUND_ADDRESS, {
    assetType: AssetType.ERC721,
    address: ERC721_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
    tokenId: ERC721_TOKEN_ID,
  });

  // ERC1155
  await propHouse.depositTo(ROUND_ADDRESS, {
    assetType: AssetType.ERC1155,
    address: ERC1155_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
    amount: ERC1155_TOKEN_AMOUNT,
    tokenId: ERC1155_TOKEN_ID,
  });
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Deposit many assets to a round</summary>

  ```ts
  import { AssetType } from '@prophouse/sdk';

  await propHouse.batchDepositTo(ROUND_ADDRESS, [
    {
      assetType: AssetType.ETH,
      amount: ethers.utils.parseEther('1'),
    },
    {
      assetType: AssetType.ERC20,
      address: ERC20_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
      amount: ERC20_TOKEN_AMOUNT,
    },
    {
      assetType: AssetType.ERC721,
      address: ERC721_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
      tokenId: ERC721_TOKEN_ID,
    },
    {
      assetType: AssetType.ERC1155,
      address: ERC1155_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
      amount: ERC1155_TOKEN_AMOUNT,
      tokenId: ERC1155_TOKEN_ID,
    },
  ]);
  ```
</details>

### House & Round Queries
---

A `query` property is exposed on the `PropHouse` instance, which exposes a variety of methods for querying house and round state.

Alternatively, the `QueryWrapper` class can be instantiated on its own:

```ts
import { ChainId, QueryWrapper } from '@prophouse/sdk';

const query = new QueryWrapper(ChainId.EthereumGoerli);
```
